Each year, hundreds of Georgia students compete to win these top honors. Teachers can use the new integrated science and art curriculum provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a basis for each participating student to research and then artistically portray a duck, goose or other waterfowl species native to North America. Design entries must be the student’s original, hand-illustrated creation and may not be traced, copied from photographs or other artists’ works. Photographs taken by the student may be used as references in the development of the design. Computers or other mechanical devices may not be used in creating artwork. All artwork submitted must be on paper and an original 9” x 12” horizontal image of an eligible North American duck, geese or swan species. All contest participants will receive the Junior Duck Stamp Program certificate of appreciation.

All artwork with attached official entry and reference forms should be mailed to the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Program, USFWS, 1875 Century Boulevard Suite 240, Atlanta, Georgia, 30345 and must be postmarked by midnight Monday, March 16, 2015, to be eligible. Additional contest information and an official entry form can be obtained online at [http://www.fws.gov/juniorduck/EntryPacket.htm](http://www.fws.gov/juniorduck/EntryPacket.htm) or by calling Carmen Simonton, the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Program Coordinator at (404) 679-7049 or email Resee_Collins@fws.gov.

The 2015 Georgia Junior Duck Stamp contest judging will take place at the Peidmont National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center in Hillsboro, Georgia, on Tuesday, April 7. A total of 100 winners and (1) Best of Show will be selected from the four different age groups: Grades K-2, 4-6, 7-9 and 10-12. The Best of Show will be sent on to compete nationally in Washington D.C. The national First Place entry is then used as the Federal Junior Duck Stamp, which is sold by the U.S Postal Service and Amplex Corporation for $5 per stamp. Proceeds from the sale of Junior Duck Stamps support conservation education and provide awards and scholarships for the students, teachers and schools that participate in the program.

The Georgia 2015 winning artwork will tour the state of Georgia on public exhibit at venues ranging from Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain, Elachee Nature Center in Gainesville, and the Macon Museum of Arts and Sciences.

Georgia’s Junior Duck Stamp competition is part of the Federal Junior Duck Stamp competition, authorized by Congress in 1994. The purpose of the Junior Duck Stamp contest is to promote conservation of wetlands and waterfowl habitat through arts education. The Junior Duck Stamp is modeled after the Federal Duck Stamp, which has been sold since 1934 to raise money to protect wetlands and waterfowl habitat.
