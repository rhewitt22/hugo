Amber Dong, 13, of Johns Creek, Georgia, is the winner of the annual 2015 Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Art Competition held Tuesday, April 7, 2015, at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in Juliette, Georgia.  Five judges unanimously selected her acrylic rendition of a Wood Duck out of 532 total entries as the Georgia Best of Show. 

Dong will receive a $175 scholarship from Georgia Power, a long-time sponsor of the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Program, as well as additional prizes. As Georgia’s Best of Show, her original artwork has been sent to compete in the national Junior Duck Stamp Competition being held Friday, April 17, 2015, at the National Conservation Training Center in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.

“I chose the Wood Duck since it is so colorful and very pretty,” said Amber, a student at the First Fine Art & Design Academy in Johns Creek.

This year, 532 Junior Duck Stamp entries were submitted from 18 different public and private schools, home schools, art studios, and after-school programs statewide.  Amber’s winning entry was submitted through Sheng Ji Qu, her Art Teacher at the First Fine Art & Design Academy. All 10 student entries submitted this year from this Academy received either First, Second, or Third place or an Honorable Mention in the 2015 Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Contest.

A panel of distinguished judges selected for their expertise in artistic design, wildlife art, and waterfowl biology decided the winners of this year’s Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Contest. A total of 100 winners were selected, featuring 25 winners in each of four different age groups:  Kindergarten to third grade, fourth to sixth grade, seventh to ninth grade and tenth to twelfth grade, as well as the State’s Best of Show. Three First Place, three Second Place, three Third Place and 16 Honorable Mention winners were chosen in each of the four categories. The Best of Show was selected from among all of the First Place winners.

The 2015 winning artwork will be made into a travelling exhibit and available for viewing throughout the next year at venues including Callaway Gardens, Macon Museum of Arts & Sciences, Chattahoochee Nature Center, Charlie Elliott Wildlife Center, Sandy Creek Nature Center and Elachee Nature Science Center.

This year’s esteemed judges featured:  Greg Balkcom, expert waterfowl biologist with Georgia Department of Natural Resources; Jim Candler, environmental affairs supervisor, Georgia Power, long-time sponsors of the Georgia Junior Duck program; Susan Welsh, executive director Macon Museum of Arts and Sciences; Bob Stewart, natural resource manager, Robins Air Force Base; and Carolyn Johnson, assistant refuge manager, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge.

Prizes and ribbons also were given for the best student conservation message that expresses the spirit of what they learned while researching and planning for their Duck Stamp Contest artwork entry. This year’s winning conservation message was submitted by 14 year-old Walter Ellard of Roswell: “When you go somewhere in the woods without phone signal, I promise you will get a better connection”.
