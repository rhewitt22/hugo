Each fall, Wings Over Water Wildlife Festival plays host to hundreds of visitors who travel from near and far. Set for Oct. 20 - 25, 2015, the six-day event is held in the shoulder season when lodging rates are lower, there is less traffic and the weather is mild. The Refuge is home to a diverse and fascinating array of wildlife to view, waterways to paddle, art to enjoy, and history to learn. In addition to marine life, black bears, and hundreds of species of birds are waiting to be spotted.
